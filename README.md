##Introduction
Project Title: Applied Machine Learning and Data Engineering in Business Context
Project Focus: Steel Plate Fault Detection
Objective: Develop an end-to-end cloud solution for fault detection in steel plates for XYZ Products.
Team Members: Alisa Ilina, Anurag Singh, Eirik Egge, Henry Stoll, Magnus Eliassen, Olivia Lundholm
##Executive Summary
###Identifying the Problem:
The most common production faults like Bumps, K-Scratches, and Z-Scratches are primarily influenced by factors such as conveyor length, steel plate thickness, and the steel type.
###Automating Fault Detection:
Implementation of the XGBoost model which correctly classifies over 80% of all faults. This allows for the transition from manual fault classification to an automated detection system.
###Moving to the Cloud:
The proposed cloud architecture leverages existing data sources, enabling efficient fault detection and providing a continuous flow of data-driven insights into the production process.
###Scaling for the Future:
The vision extends beyond just analysis. The aim is to scale automated fault diagnosis across the production line, paving the way for future high-value use cases in the domain.
###Value Proposition:
Delivering substantial value across the production line through cloud-based fault detection mechanisms.
##Background & Challenges
###Company Profile: XYZ Products, a renowned steel manufacturer located in Northern Sweden.
###Objective: Achieve a reduction in costs associated with production faults.
###Challenges:
Inefficient manual quality control mechanisms.
Significant variable costs due to faulty steel plates.
Plates detected as faulty post-sale, resulting in customer dissatisfaction.
Manual data collection process for fault labeling.
Decision-making often rooted in human assumptions instead of data-driven insights.
##Model Selection & Performance
XGBoost: Achieved an accuracy of over 80%, marking it as the best performing model for this application.
Comparative Analysis: Other models like MLP, Decision Tree, and LogReg were also evaluated, but XGBoost outperformed them all.
Process Delta: Transitioning to Automation
###Current System: Manual fault detection and classification lead to increased costs, reduced customer satisfaction, and a lack of actionable insights.
###Proposed System: An automated fault detection and prevention system powered by machine learning and cloud infrastructure. This includes:
Automatic fault detection replacing manual labeling.
AI-powered optical recognition of steel plates.
Dynamic feedback loops providing actionable insights into the production process, facilitating preventive maintenance and data-driven decision-making.
